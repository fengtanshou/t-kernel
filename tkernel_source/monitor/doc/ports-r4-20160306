reset_entry ->
@ ARM Lowlevel setup
	SVC Mode, Disable FIQ/IRQ

	Switch to T-Monitor stack

	disable:
	  * cache
	  * program-flow prediction
	  * high vector
	  * VIC
	enable
	  * force AP
	  * TEX remap
	  * Subpage AP

	Turn on VFP

@ Setup C environment

@ Call procReset, more init writen in C
	startup.c: EXPORT void procReset( void )

@ Clear registers, and initial stack pointers for all mode

@ Clear vfp again

@ Return to SVC Mode

@ endless svc call
